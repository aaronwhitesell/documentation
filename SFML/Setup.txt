1. selecting 32 or 64 bit libraries
	- On Windows, choosing 32 or 64 bits libraries should be based on which platform you want to compile for, not which OS you have.
	Indeed, you can perfectly compile and run a 32 bits program on a 64 bits Windows. So you'll most likely want to target 32 bits 
	platforms, to have the largest 	possible audience. Choose 64 bits packages only if you have good reasons.

2. apply future changes to all configurations
	- Project -> Project's Properties -> Configuration: All Configurations

3. tell compiler where to find the SFML headers 
	- Project -> Project's Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories
	- browse to "SFML-2.1\include" and add it

4. tell compiler where to find the SFML libraries
	- Project -> Project's Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories
	- browse to "SFML-2.1\include" and add it

5. link your application to the SFML libraries
	- do this for each configuration ("sfml-xxx-d.lib" for Debug, and "sfml-xxx.lib" for Release)
	- Project -> Project's Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input
	- add the 5 libraries (audio, graphics, network, system, window)
	- "-s" is a static library

6. Document how to add path to DLLs
